We were to stay in our houses\nmore than usual and that changed our lives.</p>\n<p>Besides the bug that most of you are already familiar with, 2020 was a special\nyear for me because 3 out of 4 members of my family moved abroad. This was\nplanned for 2020 but the stay-at-home situation delayed it and we had extra opportunities\nto spend time together.\nIt is not the end of the world, we are going to see each other\nand there a lot of way we are still connected but it is a massive change from having\na walking-distance between each other. They are happy and so there’s no point\nin dwelling in much else, but it was definitively a big change.</p>\n<p>Besides this small glimpse into my personal life it was a real good year for\n<strong>NoSleep Javascript</strong>. The community around it increased substantially and people\nhave been real good to me, showing support and encouragement messages.\nConsidering this is a one-man operation it has had pretty good results.\nI have also started to be more consistent with my writing\nand I believe that I improved a lot in expressing my ideas in a clear and concise way although\nI have a long way to go yet.\nIn fact this second year has ended with net positive income, nothing\nlife changing but it is still nice to see how this small operation\nnow is effectively having profits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It has been a great journey so far and I hope you stay for the ride\nwith me. We have exiting plans for the future!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This post has two purposes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A public statement of the plans for 2021.</li>\n<li>A personal commitment to do more and never falter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This post might also interest you if you yourself are building an internet business\nlike this one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-look-back-at-2020\"><a href=\"#a-look-back-at-2020\" aria-label=\"a look back at 2020 permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>A look back at 2020</h2>\n<p>The community has grown exponentially, we are still small but\nat this pace we are going to become huge!.</p>\n<p>This is the list of the most successful posts this year:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://nosleepjavascript.com/docker-essentials-for-front-end-developers/\">Essential Docker for Javascript and Front End Developers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nosleepjavascript.com/react-performance/\">React is slow, what now?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nosleepjavascript.com/bitbucket-sucks/\">Bitbucket is developer hell</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nosleepjavascript.com/programming-principles/\">Secrets of a Tech Lead: Programming Principles</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you haven’t checked them out be sure to do that, they have valuable content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-look-forward-to-2021\"><a href=\"#a-look-forward-to-2021\" aria-label=\"a look forward to 2021 permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>A look forward to 2021</h2>\n<p>Although I work professionally as a <strong>Senior software developer</strong>\nspecialised in the Javascript ecosystem <em>and</em> as a <strong>Tech Lead</strong>,\nI’m always looking elsewhere, in fact, most of the bigger lessons\nI have learnt and which you might find in my posts are from actually\nlooking outside the Javascript ecosystem and bringing back the\nmore general knowledge back and becoming an overall better developer.</p>\n<p>The plan is for next year to include some of those technologies\ninto the blog and hopefully we can <strong>extrapolate universal\nprogramming truths</strong> into our day to day work and whatever technology\nwe use in them.</p>\n<p>Let’s cover the topics I am planning on covering next year:</p>\n<h2 id=\"rust\"><a href=\"#rust\" aria-label=\"rust permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Rust</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to talk more about <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a>, teaching Rust to front end developers, talking about\nWasm (Web Assembly) and simply writing more Rust just for fun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have been a long time fun of Rust and an early tinkerer of the language, even\nbefore it reached v1 which was a very chaotic epoch.</p>\n<p>Since then Rust has consolidated as a real world programming language with revolutionary\nguarantees in a niche that has been dominated for a long time\nby arguably old and sometimes outdated languages: C and C++.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING!</strong> I don’t have anything against C and C++, please don’t take it personally, there are a lot of things\nthose languages have brought to the table and they are super valuable and they will probably\nbe for a long long time, BUT, they have widely accepted flaws like exposing themselves easily\nto memory attacks and being highly unsafe by default, and they also have some pretty old-fashioned\nidioms such as header files instead of regular modules. The build system and package ecosystem\nis far from ideal in my humble opinion, one can say a lot of bad stuff about <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">NPM</a>\nand <a href=\"https://crates.io/\">crates.io</a> but they\nhave provided a community standard to publish and share reusable packages across all environments, something\nthat up to this day is not trivial with C and C++. I know there are solutions, but none of them are standard like\nNPM and crates.io are. Additionally, Rust’s build system: <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/\">cargo</a>,\nis a standard tool that replaces all the configurations\nyou would otherwise need to, sometimes manually, dump into makefiles\nand other configuration files of sort. Cargo is a modern solution\nfor this problem and makes the barrier of entry to Rust almost null in that respect.\nFinally, Rust acknowledges\nthat in order to be productive programmers\nneed to high level constructs such as <code class=\"language-text\">map</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Option</code>, mutability helpers, and so much more.</p>\n<p>Rust has a lot of virtues, briefly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is a low level language with high level APIs.</li>\n<li>it does a lot of help you make programs that are <em>safe</em>.</li>\n<li>the community is outstandingly good both with hard skills (technicals) and soft skills (management, communication, problem resolution).</li>\n<li>a holistic approach towards building a programming language: Rust understand that a programming language is so much more than the syntax and the compiler, it involves build systems, package repositories, installers, configuration management, good quality packages, etc.</li>\n<li>is statically typed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to learning Rust early I have understood, probably the hard way, a lot about Statically Typed\nlanguages, idioms, techniques, patterns, etc; which I extrapolated without much effort to Typescript\nwhen I started using it professionally. Additionally I finally\nunderstood the benefit of statically typed languages with Rust, the experience of getting\nthe compiler to help you find the problems with your program is a humbling and enlightening\nthat if you endure (sometimes it can be frustrating) it will teach you a lot.</p>\n<p>In fact, Rust is the reason I am all in on <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">Typescript</a> and have been for the past couple of years even when\nsome of the Javascript community still has <a href=\"https://www.java.com/en/\">Java</a> PTSD\n(and cargo cult to be honest) about what type systems look\nand how they are used. To those still reluctant about Typescript I tell you:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is <em>so</em> much more to Statically Typed languages than what Java has to offer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> I do not hate Java, in fact I respect it a lot, I have felt foreign when looking at production grade\nJava code, because of its natural verbosity and because of common idioms used but my experience might be biased, so I do\nkeep and open mind and I do acknowledge that Java in 2020 is a completely different beast than what Java was 2 or 3 years ago.</p>\n<h3 id=\"web-assembly-and-rust\"><a href=\"#web-assembly-and-rust\" aria-label=\"web assembly and rust permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Web Assembly and Rust</h3>\n<p>Rust has one of the best supports for Web Assembly and it has a whole team dedicated to it.\nWasm can have a massive impact in the Javascript ecosystem, just think of it, in both Node.js\nand front end applications we are using Javascript to build compilers, macro systems, linkers (webpack),\nlinters and a lot of code that usually is built with Statically Typed Compiled languages and one of the\nmain reasons for that is performance. Javascript is really fast and has gotten really fast in the last few years\nbut still there are things that it will be naturally slower than Statically Typed Compiled and build-time optimized\nlanguages such as Rust so it is natural to think about slowly migrating stuff like\n<a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a>, Typescript,\n<a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">eslint</a> and\n<a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">webpack</a>\nto Rust for example.</p>\n<p>Imagine reducing the times it takes to compile for your large scale production application when using webpack? Isn’t that\na big win?</p>\n<p>Well, in any case Rust has lot of tooling (although a little bit immature last time I checked) to seamlessly integrate\nWasm code into Node.js, webpack, and front end applications in general, so once this tooling is mature I expect\nthe integration to be quite easy and the only real barrier will be Rust it self. So we might as well be ahead of\nthe curve and start getting really good with Rust!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rust has a great future ahead but learning it can be frustrating depending on your background,\nand I would love to help the community with that learning path since I myself have already\nbeen there and done that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence\"><a href=\"#machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence\" aria-label=\"machine learning and artificial intelligence permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</h2>\n<p>ML and AI are becoming widely used techniques to solve a wide variety of problems,\nan although right now we see them in a lot of big companies as part of their main products\nI expect that while the technology advances we are going to see more and more day to day\napplications in customer support bots or a smarter searches and with things we currently\ndon’t even imagine.</p>\n<p>I do expect ML/AI to have even more impact and be life-changing in the near future as technology\nevolves and we learn more about what is possible with them.</p>\n<p>I have been reading two books this year and I am planning on finishing them and reading\nmore.

Nothing too fancy, it is just another problem space we need\nto figure out which is something we do on a daily basis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The main idea is to write about effective communication, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/37OaEmm\">emotional intelligence</a>,\nempathy and any other soft skills\nrequired for developers while understanding that there are different people with different backgrounds that have\ndifferent experiences being socially able in the workplace.</p>\n<p>I believe that in the end this will not only impact your work life but it will also impact your personal life like\nit did to me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-health\"><a href=\"#mental-health\" aria-label=\"mental health permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Mental health</h3>\n<p>If <em>soft skills</em> refer to <strong>how we handle ourselves with other people and their emotions</strong>, Mental health\nis all about <strong>us and how we handle ourselves with and within ourselves</strong>.</p>\n<p>Developers sit down right in the junction of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis\">neurosis</a>\n(we are over thinkers),\n<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961\">anxiety</a>\n(am I going to be able to pull this off?) and\nstress (we need this work finished by tomorrow) and this situation is a severe attack\nto our mental health.
