In this context these principles, such as <strong>Clarity</strong>, will\nhave its own concrete meanings. It also is important to reflect on what it means\nto be clear for a given context and propose potential improvements if possible, which will\nbe also highly subjective. The important conclusion is, yes, these things are subjective, but\nwe do not develop software in a vacuum and so <strong>they will have more concrete meanings in the\ncontext where we develop software.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"clarity\"><a href=\"#clarity\" aria-label=\"clarity permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Clarity</h2>\n<p>Programming can be thought of as a way of expressing ideas in a formal language,\nin that sense we could even go as far as thinking <strong>programming as a weird form of art\nor even poetry</strong>, there are always those pieces of code that touch our hearts, and\nso long as we have the main goal of software in mind: solving problems, I believe\nis fine to take this idea of beauty in.</p>\n<p>Code is created with two main purposes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>to tell machines what do,</li>\n<li>to communicate ideas with other people.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If we don’t express our <strong>ideas correctly</strong> the machine will yield at us, and\nif we don’t express the <strong>right ideas</strong> then other forms of validations should yield at us i.e. unit tests.</p>\n<p>The second part is the one where <strong>Clarity</strong> becomes important.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Code should be easy to understand by our team mates.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Code should be as easy to understand as possible for our team mates\nand humans in general, that’s in fact the <strong>main purpose of programming languages</strong>,\nto go closer to humans and abstract away the machine language.</p>\n<p>How to improve <strong>Clarity</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>identify and use the main <strong>concepts</strong> in your domain i.e. <code class=\"language-text\">nodes</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">users</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">cars</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">contracts</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">unverifiedUser</code>.</li>\n<li>naming is important, take your time finding the right names.</li>\n<li>are you sure about that one liner? Maybe break it into multiple lines?</li>\n<li>read your code entirely after “finishing it” i.e. <strong>review your own PRs</strong>.</li>\n<li>identify hard to understand sections</li>\n<li>ask: how can I make them better?</li>\n<li>if you can then do that</li>\n<li>if you cannot then comment the complexity away</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes some piece of code might be reflecting something inherently\ndifficult to understand, so there’s no easy way out of that and so\nyou should add comments to those sections.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts are a fundamental idea in programming</strong>, we never deal with\nsome variable or some function, we deal with <strong>semantic concepts</strong> and\noperations that have strong meanings in the <strong>domain</strong> we are working.\nA good program will use strong concepts and thus will have good\nnaming across the board. <strong>Make sure you get the concepts right</strong>.</p>\n<p>Modern software development might involve millions of lines of code, across\nmultiple programming languages, covering complex business rules, we really\ndon’t want to make this already complicated artifact anymore and so\n<strong>Clarity becomes a tool for managing complexity</strong>.</p>\n<p>An example, I see a lot of newbie programmers abuse the indexing operation in a tight chain.</p>\n<p>Let’s say we have a contrived data structure as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">interface</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IUsersColors</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>userId<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">number</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">Array</span><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>hex<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> name<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In my experience, new programmers tend to do:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token comment\">// access the \"i\" favourite color hex</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">setColor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>usersColors<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>userId<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>But i found the following more clear albeit longer.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> selectedUserColors <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> usersColors<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>userId<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> color <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> selectedUserColors<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> colorHex <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> color<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">setColor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>colorHex<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This is my <strong>subjective</strong> judging of the code, perhaps\nin your context and for you and your team mates the\nfirst case is clearer.
