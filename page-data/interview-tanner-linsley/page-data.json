lines\nof mostly React code.</p>\n<p>The way we were managing data fetching was (and partially still is)\nby using Redux and manually writing actions, reducers,\nselectors, normalization, bookkeeping such as loading and error states\nand when/how to trigger those requests, which up to this day is pretty\ncommon way of doing data fetching with React.</p>\n<p>The verbosity and lack of guarantees and abstractions\nmade the process painful, developers dreaded fetching\nnew data and the PR reviews dragged because everybody\nhas their own opinion of what an action and a reducer\nshould look like in theory.</p>\n<p>We tried some other <a href=\"https://github.com/amplitude/redux-query\">Redux</a>\nbased solutions without\nmuch success because the fundamental problem is that\nRedux was not built to do data fetching, you can of\ncourse use it successfully but you there’s a lot of unfolded\ncomplexity you need to manage mostly manually.\nGranted, with <a href=\"https://redux-toolkit.js.org/\">Redux-Toolkit</a>\nand <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\">React hooks</a>\nthings look better but many of\nthe mentioned problems still stand.</p>\n<p>I have explored this in more details in a previous post:\n<a href=\"https://nosleepjavascript.com/redux-data-fetching-antipattern\">Stop using Redux for Data Fetching, use this instead</a></p>\n<p>Since I didn’t find any existing solutions,\nI started designing my own and these were\nsome of the core characteristics it had:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No concept of the Redux state, actions and reducers, it is just a glorified smart structured Cache</li>\n<li>Data is stored by a user defined cache key</li>\n<li>Users can mutate the cache when performing HTTP mutations (i.e. PUT)</li>\n<li>No duplicated HTTP calls: components should be able to define their data dependencies and the abstraction should take care of de-duping them.</li>\n<li>Fetching new data should require minimal boilerplate</li>\n<li>Automatic bookkeeping: loading, errors, freshness of the data should all be handled automatically</li>\n<li>The interface should be similar to <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/\">Apollo Client</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And what I have designed and was about to start coding\nended up already existing and being Tanner’s\n<a href=\"https://react-query.tanstack.com/\">react-query</a>,\na smart, small, simple, battle tested, typescript based (currently)\nlibrary of my dreams that was far beyond my original\ndesign and far beyond what I’ve probably could have made by myself.</p>\n<p>And that’s how I feel connected to Tanner,\nI like the way he writes code and I share\na lot of the same values,\nI like how he approaches open source and\nhow he always appears as a positive proactive\nindividual which is super fun to work with.</p>\n<p>And here I bring you the interview with\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tannerlinsley\">Tanner Linsley</a>,\n<em>react-query</em> creator, open source maintainer,\ndad, family man, religious man and so much more,\nlet’s get to know

I was even blessed to see many of\nthose individuals grow closer as families and eventually\nbe sealed for eternity as a heavenly family unit in one\nof Christ’s holy temples.
